Jack really likes his number five: 
the trick here is that you have to multiply each number by 5 raised to the number of digits of each numbers, so, 
for example:
multiply(3)==15 # 3 * 5
multiply(10)==250 # 10 * 5
multiply(200)==25000 # 200 * 5
multiply(0)==0 # 0 * 5
multiply(-3)==-15 # -3 * 5

def multiply(a, b):
  return a * b
