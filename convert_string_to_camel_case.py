#DESCRIPTION:
#Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing.
#The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case). 
#The next words should be always capitalized.

#Examples
#"the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
#"The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
